!! page still under construction, if you have somehow found your way here. come back when it is ready, thanks. meanwhile, my current website is at [sites.google.com/view/adwaygirish](https://sites.google.com/view/adwaygirish/home?authuser=0) !!

I am Adway, a third-year Ph.D. candidate with the Information Processing Group ([IPG](https://ipg.epfl.ch)) at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences ([IC](https://ic.epfl.ch)), **[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch)**, Switzerland. I am advised by the inimitable [Emre Telatar](https://people.epfl.ch/emre.telatar). I have also had the immense pleasure of collaborating with [Michael Gastpar](https://people.epfl.ch/michael.gastpar), [Hyeji Kim](https://sites.utexas.edu/hkim/), and [Ashok Vardhan Makkuva](http://ashokvardhan.github.io/).
My research interests are primarily in all aspects of information and coding theory. I am also interested in applying these techniques to study security, communication, and learning.

In 2022, I received a B.Tech. with honors in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Mathematics from **[IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in)**, where I was fortunate to have worked with Profs. Kumar Appaiah, Vikram Gadre, and Sibi Raj Pillai.
I spent the summer of 2021 "at" Texas Instruments (India) as a Signal Processing intern (working from home).

Here are the publications that have resulted from my research, and here are presentations I have given/will soon give. Here is a summary of my academic career, and here is everything else.

My contact information and online presence can be found in the left pane of this page.
