## About

I am Adway, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate with the [Information Processing Group (IPG)](https://ipg.epfl.ch/) at the 
[School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC)](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/), 
[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/), Switzerland. I am advised by the inimitable 
[Emre Telatar](https://people.epfl.ch/emre.telatar/?lang=en). 
I have also had the immense pleasure of collaborating with 
[Michael Gastpar](https://people.epfl.ch/michael.gastpar/?lang=en), 
[Hyeji Kim](https://sites.utexas.edu/hkim/), [Ashok Makkuva](https://ashokvardhan.github.io/) and [Shlomo Shamai](https://shamai.net.technion.ac.il/). 

I will spend five months starting October 2025 at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), thanks to my kind host [Gregory Wornell](https://web.mit.edu/gww/www/), and support from the generous EPFL Doc.Mobility grant.

My research interests are primarily in all aspects of information and coding theory. 
I am also interested in applying these techniques to study compression, communication, and learning. 
A more detailed research statement (as of November 2024) is available [here](https://adwaygirish.github.io/files/docs/adway-research-statement_11-24.pdf).

In 2022, I received a B.Tech. with honors in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Mathematics 
from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), where I was fortunate to have worked with 
Profs. Kumar Appaiah, 
Vikram Gadre, and
Sibi Raj Pillai. 
I spent the summer of 2021 at Texas Instruments (India) as a Signal Processing intern.

Here are the [publications](/publications) that have resulted from my research, 
and here are [presentations](/talks) I have given/will soon give. 
[Here](/profile) is a summary of my academic career, and [here](/misc) is everything else.
